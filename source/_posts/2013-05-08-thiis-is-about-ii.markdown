ii started out as an acronym for Instant Infrastructure, but as I looked at it more and more it looked like two people standing together. Then, as I thought about it more, it became symbolic of multiple eye's, sharing the same vision for a moment. Someone once said 'lend me your ears', but in our extremely visually oriented culture, I'd prefer if you lent me you eyes. You will see and imagine things that I won't, and without you sharing your ideas, the world will be a less bright place. 'this' with multiple eyes (yours and mine... and everyone we meet) becomes thiis. Lend me your ii's for a bit and let's try to define thiis together.  

I've been privileged to work with some pretty amazing people and it's been nice to see many of them face to face in the last few weeks. I been to two conferences in my field of work and was able to speak about ii at both of them. At the first I wrote a program with symbols on my name card written by my friends:  

> Welcome @[chefconf](https://twitter.com/chefconf) everyone! Come say hi when you see me.

I used those symbols in my talk and then put up an open document that anyone [can edit live](http://help.thiis.be/)  at [help.thiis.be](http://help.thiis.be/) and currently looks like this:  

<iframe height="315" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyilvvV7ujVMlmaM6dht8mZ6KkZunTi56ZJBrw06_DQ/pub?embedded=true" width="560"></iframe>   

It contained some thoughts about what I think thiis is and directions for registering the thiis.is domain.  

[thiis.be](http://thiis.be/) had a kind of Yoda like ring to it and I had registered [thiis.is](http://thiis.is/) before, but I had let it lapse. I didn't have the money to register it, so I put out a request for help. Anyone could have registered [thiis.is](http://thiis.is/) for themselves, but it was so much fun to trust that it could happen without my direct help. Including trusting that no one would delete everything from the directions listed at [help.thiis.be](http://help.thiis.be/) 8)  

thiis.is/faith  
thiis.is/hope  
thiis.is/love  

Powerful words,  but just ink on a page if we don't bring them to life... that's what I'm trying to do and I need your help. It doesn't matter if you are a coder, artist, chef, painter, doctor, or captain; you can continuously deliver amazing love to the world if you choose to.  

I say **<u>c</u>**ontinuously because consistency matters.  
I say **<u>d</u>**eliver because generosity is contagious.  
I say **<u>love</u>** because it's the only thing that endures.  

**<u>cd</u>** means **<u>continuously deliver</u>**

The prezi itself has the full videos and you can save a copy and change it as desired.

Someone registered thiis.is for me and we had some fun at the hackday that followed, but I'll leave that for another post. 8)
