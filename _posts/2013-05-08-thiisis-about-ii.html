ii started out as an acronym for Instant Infrastructure, but as I looked at it more and more it looked like two people standing together. Then, as I thought about it more, it became symbolic of multiple eye's, sharing the same vision for a moment. Someone once said 'lend me your ears', but in our extremely visually oriented culture, I'd prefer if you lent me you eyes. You will see and imagine things that I won't, and without you sharing your ideas, the world will be a less bright place. 'this' with multiple eyes (yours and mine... and everyone we meet) becomes thiis. Lend me your ii's for a bit and let's try to define thiis together.<br /><br />I've been&nbsp;privileged&nbsp;to work with some pretty amazing people and it's been nice to see many of them face to face in the last few weeks. I been to two conferences in my field of work and was able to speak about ii at both of them. At the first I wrote a program with symbols on my name card written by my friends:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Welcome @<a href="https://twitter.com/chefconf">chefconf</a> everyone! Come say hi when you see me.</blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIpqe5oCIAAW2x6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIpqe5oCIAAW2x6.jpg" width="400" /></a><a href="https://twitter.com/hippiehacker/status/327191002030940160">April 24, 2013</a></div><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">@<a href="https://twitter.com/jtimberman">jtimberman</a> and i sharing the first symbol of a program i want to share with you all @<a href="https://twitter.com/chefconf">chefconf</a></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIqGw1MCIAE0SDb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIqGw1MCIAE0SDb.jpg" width="400" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hippiehacker/status/327222096398786561">April 25, 2013</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">@<a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh">mitchellh</a> and i sharing a symbolic smile @<a href="https://twitter.com/chefconf">chefconf</a></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIqHcU0CMAAJSur.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIqHcU0CMAAJSur.jpg" width="400" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hippiehacker/status/327222843626631168">April 25, 2013</a></div><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Come see what this is all about <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23ChefConf">#ChefConf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23ii">#ii</a></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BItKZy3CEAAHUdA.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><strike><img border="0" height="300" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BItKZy3CEAAHUdA.jpg" width="400" /></strike></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/hippiehacker/status/327437204920078337">April 25, 2013</a><br /><br /><br />I used those symbols in my talk and then put up an open document that anyone <a href="http://help.thiis.be/">can edit live</a>&nbsp; at <a href="http://help.thiis.be/">help.thiis.be</a> and currently looks like this:<br /><br /><iframe height="315" src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyilvvV7ujVMlmaM6dht8mZ6KkZunTi56ZJBrw06_DQ/pub?embedded=true" width="560"></iframe> <br /><br /><br />It contained some thoughts about what I think thiis is and directions for registering the thiis.is domain.<br /><br /><a href="http://thiis.be/">thiis.be</a>&nbsp;had a kind of Yoda like ring to it and I had registered <a href="http://thiis.is/">thiis.is</a> before, but I had let it lapse. I didn't have the money to register it, so I put out a request for help. Anyone could have registered <a href="http://thiis.is/">thiis.is</a> for themselves, but it was so much fun to trust that it could happen without my direct help.
